# Operations on list and dict
Create a script that imports the US States data structures contained in the following script file in our Repo: https://github.com/talkpython/100daysofcode-with-python-course/blob/master/days/07-09-data-structures/code/data.py

Perform the following tasks on the list and dict. The less you look at them, the better this exercise will be. Remember: *Dicts are unsorted.*

* Print out the 10th item in each.

* Print out the 45th key in the dictionary.

* Print out the 27th value in the dictionary.

* Replace the 15th key in the dictionary with the 28th item in the list.
